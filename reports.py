# ======= Handle assignment output requirements here =======

# 1. How many unique pages did you find? Uniqueness for the purposes of this assignment is ONLY established by the URL, 
#    but discarding the fragment part. So, for example, http://www.ics.uci.edu#aaa and http://www.ics.uci.edu#bbb are the same URL. 
#    Even if you implement additional methods for textual similarity detection, please keep considering the above definition of unique pages 
#    for the purposes of counting the unique pages in this assignment.

# 2. What is the longest page in terms of the number of words? (HTML markup doesnâ€™t count as words)

# 3. What are the 50 most common words in the entire set of pages crawled under these domains? 
#    (Ignore English stop words, which can be found, for example, here (Links to an external site.)) 
#    Submit the list of common words ordered by frequency.

# 4. How many subdomains did you find in the ics.uci.edu domain? Submit the list of subdomains ordered alphabetically and 
#    the number of unique pages detected in each subdomain. The content of this list should be lines containing URL, number, for example:
#    http://vision.ics.uci.edu, 10 (not the actual number here)
